-As of now according to your given schema I have created the queries
But I have some suggestions

-We should use author_id as foreign_key in books table instead of name, So that it can be uniquely 
identified and also execution will be faster.

We can do indexing to reduce the execution time
We should include some other fields to Author table to make each row  uniquely identified


Following are the queries for the task

- Find author by name "Leo"
--SELECT name FROM authors WHERE name ILIKE 'leo%';
Time complexity O(n)

- Find books of author "Fitzgerald"
--SELECT name FROM books WHERE name ILIKE '%Fitzgerald%';

- Find authors without books
--SELECT * FROM Authors LEFT JOIN Books ON Authors.name = Books.author WHERE Books.author is NULL;
Time complexity O(mn)

- Count books per country
--SELECT COUNT(Books.author), Authors.country FROM Authors LEFT JOIN Books ON Authors.name = Books.author GROUP BY Authors.country

- Count average book length (in pages) per author
--SELECT AVG(Books.pages), Authors.name FROM Authors LEFT JOIN Books ON Authors.name = Books.author GROUP BY Authors.name
