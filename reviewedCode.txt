## Code review

Please review the sample code, as if it was submitted as a PR by a junior team member.
You are the owner of the component this functionality belongs to and are responsible for the results.

- Would it be safe to go into production?

No it is not safe to go into production.

- Does it follow best practices?

No it does not follow  best practices.

- How could we verify that it's always working as intended?

We can write test case to check the correct output

Following points are need to be taken care for question 1 and 2

	 1 => insteadOf using $providers = [$providers] statement we can pass an array from the line which calls this function  like 
              $quote = $insurance->quote(['testProvider']) 
         2 => we should put break after every case else the loop will not break even if the case is true and itereate through all the cases
         3 => We should also define a default case so that if no case matches we can even do some specific code
         4 => instead of using file_get_contents we can use curl or any 3rd party package to get data from specific url
         5 => we should put a try catch block to handle exception
         6 => we shoul handle error from the curl request to get notify if there is any error
         7 => we can set a default object to the parameter directly in the method params
         8 => One thing that is basically logical concern, as its not clear from the code what exactly price will have 
              As per my knowledge it should be a float or int so when getting data fron the url first we need to check the content of the page and 
              accordingly we should assign it to $prices variable 


## Refactoring
