I took around 1.5 hour to complete this task

Though process behind the logic 


I first focussed on validating the rows and columns, So first bunch of code does that thing

In that What I did is first created a blank array one for row and one for column 
I first checked if the item being parsed is falling between 1 to 9 if not then from there itself
I have returned false

then I have checked for duplicate values so I have pushed easch element from row to row array and 
column to column array and compared it with previous array. If it already exists then I have
invalidated the the input

The second bunch of code is for cheking valididty of 3*3 matrix

For that I have divided the whole matrix into 9 differnt matrix
For doing that I have looped through vertically and taken each row as multiple of 3

And followed the same process as I did in row and column to validate for the duplidate value in 
the matrix. 
I have not check for 1-9 as its already being check in first section.

I can Explain more about logic verbally.
